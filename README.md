# inmemoryCache
Tavisca Assignment Project-
 - Any get calls to the underlying data store should be cached in memory
- There is a limited size to the cache.
- Most recently used objects should be available in cache and the ones which are not accessed very frequently should be discarded.
- There should be provisions to flush the cache.
- Any update to any record should  update the cache and then the underlying store.(In case the updated object is present in the cache).
